        GOODS AND SERVICE TAX</h3>
      <p>
        GST is a comprehensive tax levied on the supply of goods and services, including imports, throughout the value
        chain. It is designed to streamline the tax system by replacing multiple indirect taxes with a single, unified
        tax. Implemented to create a more transparent and efficient tax environment, GST impacts businesses across
        various
        sectors, requiring meticulous management and compliance.
        Since its implementation in July 2017, GST has marked a transformative shift in the Indian tax landscape,
        consolidating a range of indirect taxes previously levied by both the Centre and States into a singular, uniform
        tax. This monumental reform has alleviated the complexities and cascading effects associated with the prior tax
        structure.
        GST's impact is extensive, influencing all facets of business operations—from tax accounting and reporting to
        enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, profitability, cash flows, and financial reporting. It also affects
        supply chain management, information technology, marketing strategies, and contract negotiations. Consequently,
        adapting to this evolving environment is crucial for businesses to remain competitive and compliant.
        At JMK & CO, we understand that navigating the complexities of Goods and Service Tax (GST) can be daunting for
        businesses of all sizes. Our mission is to simplify GST compliance and help you maximize the benefits of this
        vital tax framework.</p>

      <h3 id="tds">TAX DEDUCTED AT SOURCE

      </h3>
      <h4>
        What is Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)?</h4>

      <p>
        TDS is a method of tax collection where tax is deducted at the time of making payments for specific types of
        income. This includes salaries, interest payments, rent, professional fees, and other specified payments. The
        deducted amount is then remitted to the government by the deductor on behalf of the recipient, ensuring that tax
        is paid in advance and reducing the chances of tax evasion.
        At JMK & CO, we recognize the pivotal role Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) plays in the Indian tax system. TDS is a
        mechanism for collecting income tax at the source of income, designed to ensure a steady flow of tax revenue to
        the government while providing convenience and ease of compliance for businesses and individuals.</p>
      <h4></h4>
      Our TDS Services</h4>

      <p>
        At JMK & CO, we offer a comprehensive suite of TDS services to simplify compliance and streamline your tax
        obligations. Our services include:</p>

        deadlines are met, reducing the risk of penalties.</p>
      <h5>
        2. TDS Calculation and Reporting</h5>

        Accurate calculation of TDS amounts is crucial. We provide detailed calculations and generate reports to help
        you
        maintain precise records and ensure transparency in your tax deductions.</p>
      <h5>
        3. TDS Reconciliation</h5>

      <p>

        discrepancies. Our team conducts thorough reconciliations to ensure that your TDS credits are accurately
        reflected
